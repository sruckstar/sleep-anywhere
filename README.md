# sleep-anywhere

Are you tired of endless gunfights and robberies? It's time to take a break!

This script will allow you to go to sleep anywhere. You can choose how many hours your character will sleep.

This is a great way to pass time without using trainers or saving the game. If you like this mod, in the next versions I'm planning to add a fatigue meter for each character. You can also sleep in the car - the correct animation will work.

Press the TAB and Q (Y and LB) to open the menu.

For more realistic game play, the script includes a fatigue system. After three hours a night your character will want to sleep, and a fatigue scale will appear on the screen. Close to morning the scale will be completely filled, and the character will fall asleep on the spot and sleep for 8 hours.

To disable the fatigue system, open the SleepAnywhere.ini file and set FATIGUE to 0.
